Simple Calculator in Python
A user-friendly calculator that performs the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

- Validates user input to prevent invalid entries (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

- Prevents division by zero.

- Displays integer results without decimal places (e.g., shows 4 instead of 4.0).

- Allows the user to perform multiple operations consecutively without restarting the program.

Example:

Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the operation to perform (+, -, *, /): /  
Enter the second number: 2  
Result: 5  
Perform another operation (y/n): n  
Exiting the program...
